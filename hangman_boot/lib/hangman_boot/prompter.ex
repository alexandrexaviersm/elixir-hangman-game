  # (Difficult) If youâ€™d like an interesting challenge, write another application where the computer plays the hangman game.
  # For a simple implementation you could just blindly guess letters, starting at the most frequent.

  # You could then optimize it by looking at the possible words.
  # Youâ€™ll need to add a new API function to the dictionary to return all the words of a given length.
  # You can then use that list to decide which letter will give you the most information based on the current game state.
